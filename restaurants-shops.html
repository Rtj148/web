                The Sunday Market in Raghadan is one of the most famous traditional markets in the Al-Baha region. It has long been a central hub for traders and buyers from across the tribes of Ghamid and Zahran, as well as neighboring areas. The market is divided into
                two sections: the upper and lower parts, featuring a variety of goods, including grains, fruits, dates, dairy products, raisins, spices, livestock, ghee, honey, fabrics, clothing, firewood, and locally made household and agricultural tools.
                <br><br> Beyond its economic role, the Sunday Market holds cultural, social, and media significance. It has a deep historical legacy, as mentioned by the Swiss orientalist John Lewis Burckhardt in 1230 AH, who described it as "the official
                market of Ghamid." Over the past two centuries, the market has witnessed significant military, political, and social events, including the assassination of an Ottoman commander.
